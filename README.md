# Sudoku-Puzzle-Solver

# What's it about:
This project is about a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle called Sudoku. The most familiar form of Sudoku is the one using a 9x9 grid.
In this project, I implemented a 9x9 sudoku board enabling the user to follow the steps of solving. Apart from this, I enhanced the program by incorporating a feature
to enable the users generate sudoku boards of their preferred size (e.g. 4x4, 16x16, 25x25 etc)

# What we used:
The main data structure we used for implementing this project is stack. Apart from this, to make the program mroe efficient, we used hashmap.

# Here's a GIF showing the solving process.
We have modified the delay time so that we can see that the board is being solved.
